# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20sort%3Aupdated-desc%20-label%3Ahidden)

I get a lot of questions by email and DM. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Work. Life. Code. Whatever. If you have a question you're interested in, and would like to see the answer out in public, this is just the joint for you.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/holman/ama/issues/new) on this project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon.

Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/holman/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) filter on this repo to browse questions I've answered in the past.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, you can always ping me on Twitter [@aschmelyun](https://twitter.com/aschmelyun).
